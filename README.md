# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. We will also write a report that summarizes your analysis and helps prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age. 

Some of our results can be seen below :

Based upon our findings shown in the image above, a very large amount of employees are able to retire when they feel they are ready. I will breakdown the results as shown in the image above next:

* 25,916 Senior Engineer
* 24,926 Senior Staff
* 9,285 Engineer
* 7,636 Staff
* 3,603 Technique Leader
* 1,090 Assistant Engineer
* 2 Manager

This data shows that 72, 458 employees are ready to retire.

In conclusion, there are quite a few employees that are ready to retire when they are ready. Now we can answer a couple questions to see if there will be enough mentorship eligible employees to help when they retire.

How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

72,458 roles will need to be filled when each of the eligible employees retires.

Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

Of the 72,458 employees that are able to retire, only 1549 are mentorship eligible. In my opinion, I do not believe that there are enough mentors qualified and eligible to teach that many people. If each of the 1,549 people eligible to mentor decided to follow through with it, each person would have to mentor an average of about 46 people.
